### Biography of Kaan

**I was born on August 19, 2002, in Istanbul. I spent my high school education in the best high school in the district where I live. During my high school education, my interest in programming and computer architectures led me to computer engineering. I coded my first program when I was just 13 years old. Like every developer, my story started with "Hello World". Later, I realized that the resources I had were not enough for me and I purchased and finished countless courses from platforms such as Udemy, Courses, Khan Academy, which are a huge digital library. While continuing my programming education, I met the Linux world and had the opportunity to improve myself in this field. When I was 17, I had to take a break from my education temporarily to prepare for the University exam. After a 2-year study, I got the right to study computer engineering at one of the best universities in Turkey. Currently, I am improving myself day by day at Middle East Technical University regarding my department.**
